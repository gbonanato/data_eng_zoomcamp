The connection should be made to hostname 'db' and port '5432'. The reason for that is thaton a docker compose
network, the name used for containers communication is the service name on the yaml file, and not the container_name.
The container_name is only used as the name of the container for the host system.

As for the port, the default port used for Postgres is port 5432. Therefore the pgadmin container should connect to port 5432.  
Por 5433 is a wrong answer because it is only ther port mapped from the container port 5432 to the host system. When
containers are on the same network they can communicate directly using the internal ports.
